# Network System Security - E-Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of evidence for the module. 
It covers weekly seminars/labs and practical exercises completed during the course.
It is organised into folders: 'Lab 1', 'Lab 2', 'Lab 3'....

Folder Documents:
- Code Samples: Python Scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and HTML files.
- Outputs and Notes

The portfolio serves as a record of my engagement with course material.
